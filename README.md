===============================

Welcome to my Frogger-like game!


How to Start Game
-----------------
Download this repository, either by git clone or the .zip in the corner. Then 
open up the index.html in your browser.

How to Play
-----------
Using the arrow keys, move to the other side of the buggy road. Grabbing stars 
gets you more points than hitting the water where there isn't one.

You have 3 lives. Lose them all and the game will restart.
