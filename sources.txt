I looked up how to use random numbers in JavaScript and learned how from here:
http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/randomnum.shtml

Thanks to the Dive Into HTML5 page for some good tricks. The first was how to 
use textBaseline to make adding text to the very top easier. Another was the 
clearRect so that the score and whatever else at the top would draw on a clean
slate without after images when they changed.

Mozilla's JavaScript documentation was as helpful with figuring out how to use 
the splice function for removing a single star:

I also got some help with forEach from Mozilla as well:
